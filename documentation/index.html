<h1><u>MediaControls Module</u></h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Simple module for creating an invisible view which receives remote control events. This is useful for background
audio playback. Please note that this module does not enable your application to play audio in the background. It
just enables your application to receive the remote control events.
</p>

<h2>Accessing the MediaControls Module></h2>

<p>To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:</p>

<pre>var MediaControls = require("de.codewave.ti.mediacontrols");</pre>

<p>The MediaControls variable is a reference to the Module object.</p>

<h2>Reference</h2>

<p>There is only one API method.</p>

<h3>MediaControls.createView({left:0,top:0,width:0,height:0})</h3>

<p>Creates an invisible, zero-sized view which receives remote control events. Even though the view is invisible it
will receive touch events when added to your view. So please always create it with the above dimensions. The view
supports the following events:
<ul>
<li>remoteControlPlay</li>
<li>remoteControlPause</li>
<li>remoteControlStop</li>
<li>remoteControlTogglePlayPause</li>
<li>remoteControlPreviousTrack</li>
<li>remoteControlNextTrack.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Simple example for receiving events:</p>

<pre>var MediaControls = require("de.codewave.ti.mediacontrols");
var view = MediaControls.createView({left:0,top:0,width:0,height:0});
view.addEventListener("remoteControlTogglePlayPause", function() {
    // handle the play/pause toggle event
});</pre>

<p>For a working sample app please see the included "app.js" file. Create a new
project, add this file and install the app on your iPhone. The provided MP3 file
URL works at the moment of writing this. You can of course replace it with any
other URL or include a sample MP3 file in the app itself. After starting the
app, audio playback will start. Double click the iPhone's home button to see the task
bar. Slide right on it to get the audio controls. Use the play/pause button to
send the remote control events. You can also use earphones and other external
hardware which has remote controls. When connecting the XCode organizer you can
also have a look at the console where the app writes a log line for each remote control
event received.</p>
